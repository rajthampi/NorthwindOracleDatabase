# NorthwindOracleDatabase
A Direct Export of MSSQL Northwind sample database to Oracle 19c 

##Date: 14.06.2025

This sample database was exported directly from MS SQL to Oracle database 19c. I have dropped invalid objects, modified the PLSQL to fix the views and procedures and as on the time the DDL from 19c was creaetd, there were no invalid objects.
